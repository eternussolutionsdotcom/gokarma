# Members
##### Members are the one who are core members of the organization. They can be external members or someone who is already associated with the organization. For example, Donors, Volunteers or other amongst the constituent profiles. 

Members have a paid/unpaid membership defined for a time period. We will see that in Membership level.

To create a new member, navigate to **Constituent -> Members**.

# Set Date Format:
**Default format of Date field given in excel is mm/dd/yyyy.**
To change it so that it can accept date in our given format i.e. dd/mm/yyyy, we have to make changes in format of Date field every time we open a new excel. 
Refer the image below.

* Select the entire column of date. Right click and select Number Format.
* A new window with number format appears. Go to Date. 
* Initially the Locale(location) selected is English (United States).
* Change it to English (India) and select the format you want to display the date in.
Refer the image below.

Once selected, you can enter dates in dd/mm/yyyy format but the excel stores it in mm/dd/yyyy format. This does not affect mapping of date to our record.
> **Note: We will have to change the format of Date type field every time we open excel. **

#Dashboards:
##### Dashboard lets you visualize the KPIs and other strategic data for your donations, constituents, projects and programs, campaign and events.

######On the drop-down as shown below, there are different categories of dashboard that are created as per the data that is entered into those modules.

######There are types of charts on the dashboard:
* Drill-Down-able
* Interactive
In case of drill-down, for any given chart you can drill it down further to get more precise information out of the chart. E.g. Suppose that there’s a chart for ‘Top 5 Donors this year’, you need to know the distribution of the funds utilised by the highest paid donation on projects, we can drill it down to project to get a desired chart stating where all the donation was utilised.

** 2.	Select the parameter that you want to perform distribution for, in this case, Project
** 3.	Select the type of chart that you wish to see your data as
** 4.	Your distributed chart gets loaded as follows:

* In case of Interactive dashboards, as the name suggests, the charts are interactive; in a sense that if we click on any of the chart, the other charts map themselves to show the information pertaining to our selection. E.g. In Donor Interactive Dashboard, if we select ‘Feb 2020’ bar, the filter is automatically applied to all of the other charts that are there on the dashboard and the other charts automatically fetch and display the information pertaining to Feb 2020.

**To see how the interactive dashboard function, perform following steps:
1.	Continuing above stated scenario, please click on the ‘Feb 2020’ bar from the chart, you should be able to see the other charts e.g. ‘City wise donor’ map itself according to our selection.

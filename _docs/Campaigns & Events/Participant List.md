##### There are two types of list, Fixed and Dynamic.

* **Fixed**: In a fixed list, you can manually add members to list depending on whom we are targeting on. 
* **Dynamic**: Dynamic Participant list returns a list of members dynamically when needed, based on search criteria you set. For example, if you want to run a campaign to members of a specific city, use a dynamic list. Whenever a new record is created or updated and meets the criteria of the participant list query, it will automatically be added to the marketing list.
